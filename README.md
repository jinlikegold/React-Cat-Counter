# About the React Cat Counter

## The What

 I call this project "Feral Cat Batching: A Counter Tool for T/N/R Volunteers". It has the ability to log counts of feral cats, taking notes about each batch, as well as saving the counts and notes for reference and comparison.

## The How 

Languages used: I used React to remake the feral cat counter I originally coded in vanilla Javascript, as a learning project!

I learned so much remaking this counter app! I feel a lot more confident managing states within functions, and setting up the project design to handle multiple events and manipulate data.
 
 I was able to add a notes feature to the original simple counter app, which can be saved along with the count at any given time.
 
## The Why
 
 TRN stands for "Trap Neuter and Return" and refers to community programs for humanely reducing feral cat populations over time. 
 
 The idea behind the project is that volunteers could use this simple interactive app on their phones to record cats as they are spotted and trapped, share notes with other volunteers and get an idea of how many cats in the neighborhood have gone through the program in a given period of time.
 
## Future Versions

Additional features to consider adding, going forward:

- A place to add date
- A way to distinguish between # of cats trapped & # seen but not trapped
- A general notes section for other volunteers about the area, conditions, etc.
- Ability to delete previous notes
- Ability to edit previous notes?
- Saving data to local storage
